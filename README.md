# WeatherPy
###### The purpose of this project was to write code that would take preferred temperatures from a user and provide a list of potential vacation spots including the hotel and details about the current weather. This involved calling APIs for both weather and location. The next step was to create a map showing the route between four different cities selected for a vacation.
